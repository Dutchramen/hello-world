Saying Hello to the world by FINALLY learning to use github!

Yo peeps!  I'm relatively new to programming and I started with Java! This is also my 1st true experience with Github.  I kind of went through this with a Java class I took but the interaction was very minimal and I only created the account to let it sit for almost a year lol! But....I'm here! 

Added personal message to readme.
